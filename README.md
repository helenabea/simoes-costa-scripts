# Simoes-Costa Lab – Computational Scripts (Legacy Repository)

This repository contains utility scripts and computational workflows currently used in the Simoes-Costa Lab for genomics data analysis.

⚠️ This repository is part of an ongoing infrastructure transition. A new official lab GitHub organization is being established to centralize and standardize computational resources.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created to:

- Provide accessible analysis scripts for lab members
- Share commonly used RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and CUT&RUN workflows
- Ensure reproducibility of routine analyses
- Facilitate onboarding of new members

It currently serves as a working repository during the lab's GitHub migration process.

---

## Scope

The scripts included here cover:

- RNA-seq alignment (STAR, HISAT2)
- Single-end and paired-end processing
- ATAC-seq pipeline
- CUT&RUN pipeline

These scripts are designed for internal lab use and may require adaptation depending on dataset and computational environment.

---

## Infrastructure Notes

- Scripts assume a Linux-based environment
- Paths and parameters may need to be adjusted per project
- Software dependencies must be installed locally on the server

A standardized pipeline structure will be implemented in the new lab GitHub organization.

---

## Transition Plan

A new GitHub organization under institutional ownership is being established to:

- Host official paper-specific repositories
- Maintain reusable core pipelines
- Improve version control and governance
- Ensure long-term accessibility

This repository will eventually be archived once the migration is complete.
